### Understand the benefits of and strategies for migration to the AWS Cloud

**AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF):**  

- Provides a comprehensive approach to cloud adoption.  
- Identifies organizational capabilities for successful cloud transformations.  
- Capabilities are grouped into six perspectives: business, people, governance, platforms, security, and operations.  
- Benefits include reduced business risk, enhanced performance and security, increased operational efficiency, and growth opportunities.  

**Migration Strategies:**  

- **Project Stage**: Evaluating AWS suitability for requirements.  
- **Foundation Stage**: Initial migration and framework deployment.  
- **Migration Stage**: Establishing roles, a Cloud Center of Excellence (CCOE), and preparing for cloud operations.  
- **Reinvention Stage**: Starting new projects in AWS.  

**Seven Migration Strategies:**  

1. **Retire**: Decommissioning applications.  
2. **Retain**: Keeping applications in the source environment.  
3. **Rehost**: Migrating applications without changes (lift and shift).  
4. **Relocate**: Moving large numbers of servers.  
5. **Repurchase**: Opting for new versions/products with more value.  
6. **Replatform**: Optimizing applications for AWS capabilities.

### Cloud Economics Concepts  

- **Shift Technical Resources**: Moving to AWS allows you to shift away from managing on-premises infrastructure, freeing up resources for other priorities like optimizing resource utilization and enhancing end-user experiences.  
- **Consumption Model**: AWS promotes a pay-as-you-go model, reducing costs associated with running data centers and enabling better tracking and analysis of cost and usage.  
- **Economies of Scale**: AWS offers lower costs due to economies of scale, allowing organizations to reduce the total cost of ownership.  

**Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Components:**  

1. **Operational Expenses (OpEx)**: Daily operating costs like utilities and office supplies.  
2. **Capital Expenses (CapEx)**: Long-term investments such as buildings, servers, and equipment.  
3. **Labor Costs**: Staffing for on-premises environments, including technicians for server management.  
4. **Software Licensing**: Consideration of current licenses when migrating to AWS, including potential transferability or AWS-managed alternatives.  

**Cost Reduction Strategies:**  

- **Automation**: Implement automation to reduce costs and improve efficiency.  
- **Benchmarking and Performance Testing**: Focus on these instead of provisioning for peak demand.  
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Scale horizontally to meet demands rather than maintaining peak capacity.  
- **Data Segmentation and Targeted Reporting**: Helps reduce compliance scope and save audit time.

## Domain 2: Security and Compliance

### Introduction to Security and Compliance

- **AWS Shared Responsibility Model**:
  - Understand which security responsibilities fall to AWS and which fall to the customer.  
  - AWS manages security "of" the cloud, including infrastructure, while customers are responsible for security "in" the cloud, such as managing their data and configuring security settings.

- **Key Focus Areas**:  
  - **Security and Compliance Concepts**: Learn when and how security measures need to be implemented, recognizing that AWS abstracts some technical details but does not absolve users from security responsibilities.  
  - **Access Management**: Customers are always responsible for managing access to their AWS environment, regardless of the service used.  
  - **Security Features**: Familiarize yourself with available AWS security features and when you need to activate them, although detailed step-by-step instructions are not required for the exam.  

- **Preparation for the Exam**:  
  - Recognize the varying levels of responsibility based on the AWS service.  
  - Understand general security features in AWS and their appropriate application.  

---  

### AWS Shared Responsibility Model  

- **AWS Responsibilities**: AWS manages security "of" the cloud, which includes the global infrastructure (Regions, Availability Zones, edge locations), hardware, network, compute, storage, databases, and the software that supports these services. AWS handles the security and management of these foundational elements.  

- **Customer Responsibilities**: Customers are responsible for security "in" the cloud, which involves managing their data, applications, operating systems, network configurations, and firewall settings. Specific responsibilities include:  
  - Client-side data encryption and integrity.  
  - Server-side encryption.  
  - Protecting network traffic, such as using SSL certificates.  
  - Identity Access Management (IAM).  
  - Customer data security and backups.  

- **Examples of Responsibility**:  
  - **Amazon EC2**: Customers are responsible for patching, managing the operating system, and configuring security settings.  
  - **Amazon RDS**: AWS handles patching and maintenance as it is a managed service, reducing customer responsibilities.  

- **Understanding Service Levels**: The level of customer responsibility changes based on whether the AWS service is managed or unmanaged. Managed services (like Amazon RDS) require less customer involvement in security tasks compared to unmanaged services (like Amazon EC2).  

- **Exam Preparation**: Know the distinctions between customer and AWS responsibilities for various services, including Amazon RDS, Amazon EC2, Amazon DynamoDB, and AWS Lambda.
